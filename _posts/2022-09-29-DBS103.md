### Purpose of a Database

- **purpose** of a database
: *to keep track of things*
- store imformation that is *more complicated* than a simple list (or spreadsheet)

### Problems with Lists :

- ***Redundancy***
    - same information may be entered several times (쓸데없는 반복)
    - (ex) a list of projects / 수강과목의 교수님 이름(young)의 반복
    
- ***Multiple themes***
    - each row may contain information on more than one theme
    - needed information may appear in the lists only if information on other temes is also present

### List Modification Issues

- Redundancy and multiple themes create modification problems
    - ***Deletion*** problems
    - ***Update*** problems
    - ***Insertion*** problems
- (ex) student database (new guys ? young → ? )

---

update, delete, insert data !

### Addressing the Information Complexities

- ***Relational databases*** are designed to address many of the information complexity issues

### Relational Databases

- A ***relational database*** stores information in tables. Each information topic is stored in its own table
- In essence, a relational database will break-up(쪼개다) a list into several parts. One part for each theme in the list
- (ex.) A Project List would be divided into a CUSTOMER Table, a PROJECT Table, and a PROJECT_MANAGER Table

### Putting the Pieces Back Together

- In our relational database, we ***broke apart our list into several tables***. Somehow the tables must be ***joined back together***
- In a relational database, tables are joined together *using the **value of the data***
- If a PROJECT has a CUSTOMER, the *Customer_ID* is stored as a column in the PROJECT table. The *value* stored in this column can be used to retrieve specific customer information from the CUSTOMER table

### Sounds like More Work, Not Less

- A relational database is more complicated than a list
- However, a relational database **minimizes data redundancy, preserves complex relationships among topics, and allows for partial data**
- Furthermore, a relational database provides **a solid foundation** for user forms and reports

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

- ***Structured Query Language (SQL)*** is an international standard for creating, processing and querying databases and their tables
- Many database applications use SQL to retrieve, format, report, insert, delete, and/or modify data for users

> Database management에 사용하는 international standard ⇒ SQL

### SQL Example

- We can use SQL to *combine* the data in the three tables in the Art Course Database to recreate the original list structure of the data.
- We do this by using an SQL SELECT statement

- example
    
    ```sql
    SELECT  CUSTOMER.CustomerLastName,
    		CUSTOMER.CustomerFirstName,
       		CUSTOMER.Phone,
    		COURSE.CourseDate, ENROLLMENT.AmountPaid,
    		COURSE.Course, COURSE.Fee
      FROM  CUSTOMER, ENROLLMENT, COURSE
      WHERE CUSTOMER.CustomerNumber
    					= ENROLLMENT.CustomerNumber
    	AND COURSE.CourseNumber
    					= ENROLLMENT.CourseNumber;
    ```
    

    

### Database System

- The four components of a database system are :
    - **Users**
        - Use a database application to track things
        - Use forms to enter, read, delete and query data
        - produce reports
    - **Database Application**
    - **Database Management System (DBMS)**
    - **Database**
        - A database is a ***self-describing*** collection of related records
        - **Self-describing**
            - The database itself contains the definition of its structure
            - Metadata is data describing the structure of the database data
        - Tables within a *relational database* are related to each other
    
    - users - Database Application - DBMS - Database
        
    - User data, Metadata, Indexes and other overhead data, Application metadata
    

### Database Management System (DBMS)

- A database management system(DBMS) serves as an **intermediary between database applications and the database**
- The DBMS manages and controls database activities
- The DBMS creates, processes and administers the database it controls

### Functions of a DBMS

- Create database
- Create tables
- Create supporting structures
- Read database data
- Modify database data (insert, update, delete)
- Maintain database structures
- Enforce rules
- Control concurrency
- Provide security
- Perform backup and recovery

### Referential Integrity Constraints

- The DBMS will enforce many **constraints**
- Referential integrity constraints ensure that the values of a column in one table are valid based on the values in another table
    - PROJECT table의 customerID가 5라면 CUSTOMER table에 CUSTOMERID가 5인 고객이 있어야한다.

### Database Applications

- A database application is a set of one or more computer programs that serves as an **intermediary between the user and DBMS**

### Functions of Database Applications

- Create and process forms
- Process user queries
- Create and process reports
- Execute application logic
- Control database applications

### Personal Database Systems

- Personal database systemss typically:
    - Have one application
    - Have only a few tables
    - Are simple in design
    - Involve only one computer
    - Support one user at a time

> PC에 database 설치 → personal database (ex. 김밥집 ~ 편의점은 회사 중앙서버 database라 personal이라고 할 수는 없음)
> 

### Enterprise-Class Database Systems

- Enterprise-Class database systems typically:
    - Support several users simultaneously
    - Include more than one application
    - Involve multiple computers
    - Are complex in design
    - Have many tables
    - Have many databases
